# About 
* This s a Dynamic Image gallery. when you put the curser on the images they move up. When you click on the image it goes to the authors unsplash page. When you click on the link it goes to the there wiki page. 


# elements used 
*  For the Forloop what i used was the for (let i = 1; i < myImages.length; i++)
*  For the figures i used the DomElement method. 
*  created all the divs using docuemnt.createElement
*  used appendchild to run it all on the html page. 
*  coouldent get the hight to work. but realised its the same line of code as the width just height instead.
